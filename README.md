# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

This project implements a simple command-line version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using Python. It's designed to be educational and straightforward, suitable for beginners learning Python programming concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Random number generation
- User input and output handling

It serves as a practical exercise to apply these concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## Key Features

- **User vs Computer**: Play against the computer which randomly selects its move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- **Input Validation**: Handles user input validation to ensure only valid choices ('r', 'p', 's', 'q') are accepted.
- **Game Loop**: Continues to play rounds until the user chooses to quit.
- **Outcome Display**: Displays the result of each round (Win, Lose, or Draw) based on the game rules.
- **Simple Interface**: The game runs in the command line interface, making it accessible and easy to understand.
